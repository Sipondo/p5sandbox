# p5sandbox

Repository with a lot of basic p5.js sketches to try out and teach the basics of programming. Sketches are sorted in folders based on topic.

## 📚 Topics Covered

This repository contains interactive p5.js sketches organized by programming concepts:

- **Basics** - Canvas setup and fundamental drawing functions
- **Shapes** - Drawing ellipses, rectangles, lines, and triangles
- **Colors** - RGB colors and transparency (alpha channel)
- **Animation** - Moving objects and basic animations
- **Interaction** - Mouse and keyboard input handling
- **Loops** - For loops and nested loops for patterns
- **Conditionals** - If/else statements and decision making
- **Arrays** - Storing and managing multiple values
- **Functions** - Creating reusable custom functions

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser to see all available sketches
2. Click on any sketch to view and interact with it
3. Each sketch includes a description of what it demonstrates

## 💡 Learning Path

For beginners, it's recommended to go through the sketches in this order:
1. Start with **Basics** to understand the canvas
2. Move to **Shapes** to learn drawing
3. Explore **Colors** to add visual variety
4. Try **Loops** to create patterns efficiently
5. Learn **Conditionals** for decision making
6. Experiment with **Animation** to make things move
7. Add **Interaction** for user input
8. Use **Arrays** to manage multiple objects
9. Create **Functions** for reusable code

## 🛠️ Technologies

- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) - JavaScript library for creative coding
- Pure HTML/CSS - No build process required

## 📝 Usage

All sketches can be run directly in a web browser. No installation or build process is needed. Simply open any `.html` file in your browser.

You can also serve the files using a local server:
```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js http-server
npx http-server
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## 🎓 About p5.js

p5.js is a JavaScript library that makes coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners. It's based on Processing, a flexible software sketchbook and language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts.
